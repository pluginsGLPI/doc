Register your application in Entra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, register your application with your Entra Active Directory (Entra AD) client. This will provide you with an application ID for your application and allow it to receive tokens.

-  Connect to the `Entra portal <https://entra.microsoft.com/#home>`__
-  Choose your Entra AD tenant by selecting your account in the top right corner of the page. Then select the **Change directory** navigation bar, then the desired tenant
-  Skip this step if you only have one Entra AD tenant under your account or if you have already selected one

.. Warning::
   When you click on **add**, **the secret will only be available once**. As soon as you leave this page, **the secret will be hidden** and we will no longer be able to access it. Remember to **store it in a safe place** as we will need it later

1) **User Principal Name (UPN)**: this option will show the full username of the user logging in (nom.prenom@mondomaine.com for example). If you want only the username to be visible (without the @mondomaine.com, see the **XXXXXXXXXX** paragraph).
2) **Entra user ID (OID)**: this option takes the object ID from the Entra AD. This ID will be used for the user login

3) **Email address**: This option specifies the userâ€™s email address. This field will be used for the login. If it is empty, the UPN will be used.

If you need to find your application in the Entra portal, select **Application subscriptions**, then **Display all applications**.
