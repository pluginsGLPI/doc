Discovery
---------

Now that our provider has been created into GLPI, we can start working on the cloud inventory.

* For each provider you can manually trigger synchronisation here :

.. figure:: images/view_discovery.png
   :alt: Discovery view
   :scale: 50 %


* You will be able to visualize the progress of the discovery.

.. figure:: images/run_discovery.png
   :alt: run the discovery
   :scale: 50 %

* Or simply configure related automatic actions (you can filter by provider name (e.g. OVH)) (see see :doc:`CronTask <crontask>`)
