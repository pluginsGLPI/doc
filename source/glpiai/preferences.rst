By clickinig on configure preferences, you can setup a context and a role

- The **context** can be a description of your company, your mission, your job in the company. AI needs to understand your context if it is to respond as pertinently as possible (there is a context by default that you can change).
- the **role** is how the IA should respond. Does it have a teaching, advisory or expert role? The role can influence the tone and level of detail of the response (there is a role by default that you can change).
