1.  In usage limit, indicate a value not to be exceeded. If this limit is accrossed, the plugin will no longer work until it is increased.
2.  Indicate the real value of your API Key (https://platform.openai.com/usage). This value must be updated when the plugin usage data is not coordinated with the real API value.
