Management by entity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Management by entity is possible to manage the counting of notifications by entity.

- Go to **Administration > Entities**, and select the desired entity.
- In the **Unread messages** tab, select the option that suits you so that unread messages behave differently to the parent entity.
