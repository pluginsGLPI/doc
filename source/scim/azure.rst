-  In the “Provisioning” section,

   -  Select **Automatic**,
   -  Fill **Tenant Url** with the API url of your SCIM server you copied from the :ref:`plugin configuration <setup_scim>`.
   -  Optionally, fill **Secret** field:
      For Azure, the awaited secret is a long life valid jwt token.
      We cannot use an oauth exchange (Azure doesn’t ask for an authorize URL).
      So in GLPI, setup you SCIM server with **Bearer** security and paste the JWT token from GLPI in the **Secret token** field of Azure.
   -  Click on the **Test connection** button to validate your parameters.
   -  If the test succeed, click on the **[Save]** button.
