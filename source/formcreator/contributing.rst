Adding new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**You are a developer ?**

You can help us adding new features by forking the GitHub repository.

Develop the new feature on your branch and then, ask for a `pull request <https://github.com/pluginsGLPI/formcreator/pulls>`__ to merge your development into the repository.

You can also help us debug the `declared issues and requested features <https://github.com/pluginsGLPI/formcreator/issues>`_.

**You are not a developer ?**

You can submit your ideas of new feature by `creating an issue <https://github.com/pluginsGLPI/formcreator/issues>`_ or adding comment on an existing issue (to add explanations or just to say "I'm also interested").

See also the `roadmap <https://github.com/pluginsGLPI/formcreator/milestones>`_

Help us debug
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are a developer and want to code the fix yourself, just read the paragraph bellow...

But if you are not a developer or don't want to develop fixes yourself, you can still help us by creating `issues <https://github.com/pluginsGLPI/formcreator/issues>`_.
Indicate your GLPI and plugin's version and steps to reproduce for a faster and easier fix.

Documentation

You can fork the `documentation repository <https://github.com/pluginsGLPI/doc>`_ to add new contents or fix some issues in existing content.
