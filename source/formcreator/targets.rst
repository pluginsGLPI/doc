Targets
-------

Targets are objects generated by FormCreator submission. If a form requires validation, the targets are delayed until approbation.

.. Note::
    Targets are currently tickets only.


A target ticket defines the ticket generated by  the form. You may have several targets per form.


Open the tab `Destination` and create a target with a name and a type (currently ticket only).

Ticket target
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ticket target generates a ticket.

The ticket is build from scratch or from a ticket template available in GLPI. You may 
* customize the title and description of the ticket, using questions and and answers,
* set a due date,
* set the urgency from a question,
* choose the entity of the ticket among many policies,
* assign  tags to the ticket if the plugin `Tags` is available,
* define actors of the ticket.

.. Note::
    Setting an urgency from a question overrides the urgency defined in a ticket template (if any)

.. Note::
    Setting a category from a question overrides the category defined in a ticket template (if any)
