Targets
-------

Targets are objects generated by FormCreator submission. If a form requires validation, the targets are delayed until approbation.

.. Note::
    Targets are currently tickets only.


A target ticket defines the ticket generated by  the form. You may have several targets per form.


Open the tab `Destination` and create a target with a name and a type (currently ticket only).

Target ticket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A target ticket generates a ticket.

.. image:: images/target_ticket_creation.png

The ticket is build from scratch or from a ticket template available in GLPI. You may

* customize the name of the target ticket to distinguish it from possible other targets,
* customize the title and description of the ticket using questions and answers,
* set tne destination entity of the generated ticket,
* set a time to resomve (formerly due date),
* set the type of ticket (request or incident),
* set the associated elements,
* set the category,
* set the urgency,
* set the location,
* assign tags to the ticket if the plugin `Tags` is available,
* link the generated ticket to other tickets
* define actors of the ticket.
* define conditions to meet to generate the target ticket

.. Note::
    Setting an urgency, a category or a location (specific or from a question) overrides the urgency defined in a ticket template (if any)

Destination entity
""""""""""""""""""

Many choices are avaialble:

* Current active entity: the entity of the requester who fills a form,
* Default requester's entity: the default entity defined for the user who fills the form,
* First dynamic requester's entity (alphabetical): sorts all dynamic entities of the requester alphabetically and selects the first one,
* Last dynamic requester's entity (alphabetical): sorts all dynamic entities of the requester alphabetically and selects the last one,
* The form's entity: the entity where is located the form being filled by the requester,
* Default entity of the validator: the default entity of the validator who validates the request,
* Specific entity: an entity set by the form's designer,
* Default entity of a user type question answer: the default entity of a user choosen by the requester in a question.
* From a GLPI object > Entity type question answer: the entity choosen by the requester from a question.

.. Note::
    Default requester's entity may be not set, then there is a risk to generate tickets in the root entity.

.. Note::
    Default entity of the validator may be not set, then there is a risk to generate tickets in the root entity.

.. Note::
    Dynamic requester's entity requires user synchronization, then there is a risk to generate tickets in the root entity.
