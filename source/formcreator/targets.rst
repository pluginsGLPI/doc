Targets
-------

Targets are objects generated by FormCreator submission. If a form requires validation, the targets are delayed until approbation.

.. Note::
    Targets are currently tickets only.


A target ticket defines the ticket generated by  the form. You may have several targets per form.


Open the tab `Destination` and create a target with a name and a type (currently ticket only).

* customize the title and description of the ticket using questions and answers,

* choose the entity of the ticket among many policies,
* assign tags to the ticket if the plugin `Tags` is available,
* define actors of the ticket.
* set  the category of the ticket

.. Note::
    Setting an urgency from a question overrides the urgency defined in a ticket template (if any)
