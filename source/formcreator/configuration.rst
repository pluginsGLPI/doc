* **Need to be validate**: If **Yes** a list of validators is displayed. This is a list of GLPI users (with the right **Validate an incident** or **Validate a request** (in its profile) on an compatible entity with the form's entity. The list of validators is a multiple choice list. If no validator is selected all of them are submitted when the form is being used.
* **Default form in service catalog**: if **Yes** the form will display in the service catalog without being filtered by the current category or keywords.

When all fields are filled, click on the **add button** at the botoom of the page.

Conditions
----------

Conditions are expressions involving questions and sections which are evaluated in order to determine

* if a section is displayed
* if the submit button of a form is displayed
* if a target (see below) must be generated

Available operators in an assertion are:

* equals
* not equals
* less than
* greater than
* less than or equal
* greater  than or equal
* is visible
* is not visible
* matches a regular expression

The condition expression can be used with the following rules:

* **Hidden unless**: the item is hidden or not generated except when the expression is true
* **Displayed unless**: the item is displayed or generated except when the expression is true


Access types
------------

Three values are available:

* **Public access**: Anonymous users may access the form; you may use it in an intranet.
* **Private access**: Users having a GLPI account may access the form.
* **Restricted access**: Only users having the specified profiles may access the form.

When a form is set to **Public access** it is possible to enable a simple captcha. This captcha should prevent spamming if a form is accessible from internet.

.. Note:: Captchas are not enabled by default on anonymous forms. Administrators need to enabled them explicitly depending on how the form may be accessible from an hostile network such Internet.

Targets
-------

There are two types of targets for a form:

* tickets
* changes

It is possible to generate any number of targets from a single form. Mixing types of targets is also possible.

To create a target click on the link **Add a target**

 .. image:: images/add_target.png

The following window is then displayed:

 .. image:: images/add_target_form.png

Choose a target name and type, then validate. The new target is created and is available for tuning.

Preview
-------

This tab allows you to view how the form will be rendered and test it without activating it.

.. note::
    Submitting answers from the preview will be actually saved, and will generate targets if the form is not configured with validation.

Form answers
------------

This tab shows all answers saved for the form.

.. note::
    To delete a form, all its answers must be deleted first. A warning shows at the bottom of the main tab of a form as a reminder.


Categories
----------

**Menu** : `Setup > Dropdowns : Forms > Form categories`

Form categories allow you to arrange your forms list. Forms are displayed when they belong to the selected category or any sub category. When a form does not have any category, it is displayed when no category is selected or when the user selects "view all".

You can add or edit categories generally from the Setup menu : `Setup > Dropdowns`.

You can also add new categories directly from the form page like all GLPI dropdowns.

They are defined by entities and can be translated since GLPI 0.85 like all other dropdowns.

.. note::
   Dropdowns translation must be enabled on GLPI general configuration page `Setup > General`, `General setup > Translate dropdowns = Yes`

.. note::
   Categories may be associated to `Knowledge base categories`. This link is necessary to allow FAQ entries to show along your forms.

Questions
---------

After the creation of a form, create fields for for the user to fill out.

.. image:: images/question_creation.png

The name of the questions will appear on the left and the field type selected on the right

The Description will be under the input field.

Additional optioins may be displayed depending on the currently selected question type..

If validation of the input is desired, it can be implemented following `PHP Regular Expressions <http://php.net/manual/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php>`_.

If you want to show or hide questions depending on the answers of other questions, use the *show fields* area when editing a question. In the version 2.5.0 you may use more complex expressions checking for the content of several questions, and use logic operator **OR** and **AND**. The precedence of boolean operators applies, meaning that **AND** has precedence over **OR**.

Translation
-----------

In some cases a form should be available in several languages. Choose first in which language a form should be created. This language should be english (US or UK) or the language that most of target users understand. This is the fallback language if no alternative is found.

This language is also used as reference in the translation process. Then be sure that the choosen langauge us readable by the user who will translate the form.

To translate a form open the tab **Form languages**, then create all languages you need to provide to users.

.. image:: images/translation_add_language.png

Choose a language added to the form and click it to begin or resume translation, then select the tab **Translations**. Click the button **New translation** and a popup dialog will open and show a string to translate. Type the translation, and click save or validate with **Enter** on your keyboard.

.. image:: images/translation_string_translation.png

If an other string must be translated, it will show immediately. If no more string needs to be transalted, a message will show instead.

.. image:: images/translation_no_more_string.png

When you close the dialog the list of translated strings is refreshed. You can edit a translatin by clicking on it, delete one or several translations with the checkboxes on the left of the list and the **Delete** button**. You can also filter the list with the filter input box.
