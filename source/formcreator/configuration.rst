Preview
-------

This tab allows you to view how the form will be rendered and test it without activating it.

    Submitting answers from the preview will be actually saved, and will generate targets if the form is not configured with validation.

Form answers
------------

This tab shows all answers saved for the form.

**Menu** : `Setup > Dropdowns : Forms > Headers`

Headers are rich texts _(text with presentation: bold, italic, titles, colors, etc.)_ which are defined per entities.
They can be translated since GLPI 0.85 like all other dropdowns
_(Dropdowns translation must be enabled on GLPI general configuration page: Setup > General : General setup > Translate dropdowns = Yes)_.

These texts are shown on the users forms list, over the forms.
It can be used to indicate some general advertisement over all the forms below.

Questions
^^^^^^^^^

After the creation of a form, create fields for for the user to fill out.

.. image:: images/glpi_from__creation_questions.png

The name of the questions will appear on the left and the field type selected on the right

The Description will be under the filed input.

Based on question type options will be based on type chosen.

If validation is desired, it can be implemented following `PHP Regular Expressions <http://php.net/manual/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php>`_.

If you want to show or hide questions depending on the answers of other questions, use the *show fields* area when editing a question. In the version 2.5.0 you may use more complex expressions checking for the content of several questions, and use logic operator **OR** and **AND**. The precedence of boolean operators applies, meaning that **AND** has precedence over **OR**.

Helpdesk
^^^^^^^^

The plugin can provide its own design for helpdesk.

To enable it, edit an entity, open the `Forms` tab and set the field `Helpdesk mode` to `Service catalog simplified` or `Service catalog extended`. This setting handles inheritance from parent entity to children entities.

Users using the simplified interface will benefit a new interface allowing them to:

* browse forms and FAQ with the unified interface
* follow the process of their requests
* book assets
* view their feeds

Users using the extended interface have a more complete view on their requests.

Forms with `Direct access on homepage` enabled and `FAQ items` in the `Knowledge base` will will appear in the interface. Users may search by browsing the categories on the left of the screen, and may also search for forms or FAQ with a natural language search engine.

FAQ items needs to be associated to knowledge base categories. The knowledge base categories must be associated to form categories (available in `Setup > Dropdowns : Forms > Form categories`) to show their content.
