OAuth IMAP
==========

.. note::
   Microsoft is gradually removing the TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols for all Microsoft 365 applications. In order to keep your collector running, you need to add the **Oauth IMAP** plugin, which is available in the marketplace.

.. tip::
   The Oauth tokens for the collector, retrieved during authentication with Azure by the OauthIMAP plugin, are “offline” tokens that delegate authorisation to a third-party application (GLPI). These tokens provide a renewal code that will be used by the application to renew them automatically without user intervention. You will therefore not be asked to re-authenticate after the 1st authorisation request.
