Security
--------

For a production instance, in GLPI, you must activate the **Strict** option in setup plugin SAML.

We advise you to activate **JIT user creation**. This will allow the rules you create from JIT Rules to be applied.

.. Warning::
    For the plugin to authenticate a user, the field must contain a **valid UPN** formatted **as an email**.
    This behaviour can lead to duplicate entries in GLPI when users leave Ldap.
    This is an important detail because some users who leave Active directory in certain scenarios still use the usersam account name
    (old netbui names) as the UPN in entra.
    As a result, the nameId field in the samlResponse will not be populated with a valid email address.
    The username field is used because the email field is not guaranteed to be unique in GLPI and it is essential that a
    unique identifier is used to allow authorisation of a specific GLPI user.

Add users allowed to use SAML
-----------------------------

SAML needs users/groups to be added so that they are authorised to use authentication.

* On your appl, click on **Viex details** tab in **User access**
* Click on **On for everyone**
* Click on **Save**
