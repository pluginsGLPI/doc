Rules for assigning authorisations
----------------------------------


It will be necessary to establish rules for assigning authorisations to your users (to give them a profile, for example).

To do this, go to **Administration** > **Rules** > **Rules for assigning authorisations to a user**.

There are no ‘mandatory’ rules, it’s up to you to create the rule(s) that you feel best suit your needs according to your available criteria.

For example, you want your users with SSO authentication to obtain the Self-Service profile.

You would set your criteria and action as shown here:
