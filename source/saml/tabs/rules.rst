Rules for assigning authorisations
----------------------------------


It will be necessary to establish rules for assigning authorisations to your users (to give them a profile, for example).

To do this, go to **Administration** > **Rules** > **Rules for assigning authorisations to a user**.

There are no ‘mandatory’ rules, it’s up to you to create the rule(s) that you feel best suit your needs according to your available criteria.
