Operation
---------

Translating an Element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Translation of a ticket element is done by activating the translation button located at the top right of the element. The target language will correspond to the user's preferred language.

..

    If the translation button does not appear, it may be due to various reasons:
        * the plugin is not configured
        * you do not have the right to translate
        * your preferred language is not allowed in the configuration
        * the element you want to translate is not allowed in the configuration

Undo Translation / Display Original Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once an element is translated, it will remain so until you request to undo the translation and display the original version. Displaying the original version is done through the same button used to translate an element, located at the top right of the element.

Translate Entire Timeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to translate the entire timeline at once. To do this, display the additional options menu at the bottom right, next to the "Save" button. Then, click on "Translate all elements."

Undo Translations / Display Original Versions of Entire Timeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If all timeline elements are translated and you want to display their original versions, display the additional options menu at the bottom right, next to the "Save" button. Then, click on "Undo translation of all elements."

Translating a Follow-up during Writing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to translate a follow-up before it is sent. To do this, write your follow-up and click on the drop-down menu at the top right of the follow-up editing window. Finally, select the language in which the follow-up's content should be translated.

Once your follow-up is translated, you can revert to the original text by selecting the "Original" option in the previous language selection menu.

This feature is also available for tasks, validation requests, and solutions.

    If the translation menu does not appear, it may be due to various reasons:
     * the plugin is not configured
     * you do not have the right to translate
     * the element you want to translate is not allowed in the configuration

Persistence of Translations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To reduce character consumption and improve plugin performance, translations are saved in the database. This approach allows sharing translations among all users, avoiding the need to translate the same element multiple times in the same language.

Translation requests from a user for an element are also saved, automatically displaying the translated version when returning to a ticket's timeline.

    If an element is modified, old translations will be considered obsolete. When a user requests a translation, a new translation will be performed for that element.

DeepL API Key
-------------

The **Translate** plugin uses the DeepL translation service. For this, a DeepL API key is required. DeepL offers two API plans, a free plan (limited to 500,000 characters per month) and a paid plan (at €4.99/month + €0.00002/character). Both plans are supported by the plugin.
