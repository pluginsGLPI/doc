Setting up the plugin
---------------------

Creating a credit type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  From **Setup > Dropdowns**,
-  click on **Credits** then **Credit types**.

.. figure:: images/Credit-2.png
   :alt: search credit
   :scale: 100 %

-  Click on **add**.

.. figure:: images/Credit-3.png
   :alt: add credit
   :scale: 60 %

Add credit to customer entity(ies)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example : We will create 3 types of credit:

   - For a new follow-up
   - For a new task
   - For a new solution

   You can create a single type of credit which will group together the 3, it depends on the management of each case.

-  In **Administration > Entities**, select the entity that will receive the credits.
-  Go to the **Credit** section
-  In the section **Add a credit**, enter a name for the new credit
-  Define the type of credit created earlier
-  The start and end dates of the credit
-  Activate it,
-  Make it available or not in the child entities (note that if you are in the parent entity, it will be accessible to all entities)
-  The quantity of credit sold
-  The authorisation to overconsume or not
-  Click on **add**

.. figure:: images/Credit-4.png
   :alt: add voucher
   :scale: 42 %

Here, we’ll do the same for the 3 types of credit (followup, task and solution)

It is therefore possible to enter different values (number of credits, validity, overconsumption, etc.) for each credit:

.. figure:: images/Credit-5.png

Define default values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In **Administration > Entities**, select the entity that will receive the credits
-  Go to the **Credit** section
-  In the **Default options for entity** section
-  Select the type of credit by action

  .. figure:: images/Credit-6.png

-  Click on **Update**

.. warning::
   "Caution Indicating credit types does not allow automatic settlement. It pre-selects the credit but it must be settled by the technician.

Counting credits
----------------

When a ticket is created, you can choose whether or not to deduct the
corresponding credits.

In our example, we have chosen to deduct each action.

-  If we are doing a **follow-up**, we can deduct the credit assigned by default:

.. figure:: images/Credit-7.png
   :alt: add credit on ticket
   :scale: 90 %

-  The same for a **task**:

.. figure:: images/Credit-8.png
   :alt: add credit on task
   :scale: 95 %

-  And for a **solution** :

.. figure:: images/Credit-9.png
   :alt: add credit on solution
   :scale: 85 %

In the **Credit** section of the ticket you can see a summary of credits spent and remaining

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Credits will be automatically reallocated in the credit bank

Including an expired credit
---------------------------

If the credit has expired, it will not be proposed in the list of available credits. You will not be able to deduct it. You will need to change the end date of the credit to be able to use it again.

Notification of expired credits
-------------------------------

An automatic action is available to notify you when a credit has expired.

-  From **Setup > Automatic actions**, modify the **creditexpired** action to suit your needs.
-  Click on **Save**

.. figure:: images/Credit-13.png

You can of course customise the notification to suit your needs (**Setup > Notifications > Notifications > credit expired**)
